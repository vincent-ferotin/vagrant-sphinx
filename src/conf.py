# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
# import os
# import sys
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

release = '{} - {}'.format(version, today.isoformat())


# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# and their related options:

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

# The language for content autogenerated by Sphinx. Refer to documentation
# for a list of supported languages.
#
# This is also used if you do content translation via gettext catalogs.
# Usually you set "language" from the command line for these cases.

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = 'alabaster'

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".

# -- Options for LaTeX output ------------------------------------------------

    # `babel` package inclusion, default to '\\usepackage{babel}'
    # (the suitable document language string is passed as class option,

    # '\\usepackage{polyglossia}'.
    #
    #'babel': '\\usepackage{polyglossia}',

    # Inclusion of the `fncychap` package (which makes fancy chapter titles),
    # default to '\\usepackage[Sonny]{fncychap}' for internationalized docs.
    # Other `fncychap` styles you can try are 'Bjarne' for english doc.,
    # 'Lenny', 'Glenn', 'Conny', 'Rejne' and 'Bjornstrup'.
    # You can also set this to '' to disable fncychap.
    #
    #'fncychap': '\\usepackage[Sonny]{fncychap}',

    # As for title and author used in the tuples of latex_documents,
    # it is inserted as LaTeX markup.
    #
    'releasename': 'Version',

    # `tableofcontents` call, default '\\sphinxtableofcontents'
    # (it is a wrapper of unmodified \tableofcontents, which may itself
    # be customized by user loaded packages).
    # Override if you want to generate a different table of contents or
    # put content between the title page and the TOC, or disable TOC insertion.
    #
    #'tableofcontents': '\\sphinxtableofcontents',

    # `printindex` call, the last thing in the file, default '\\printindex'.
    # Override if you want to generate the index differently or append
    # some content after the index.
    # For example '\\footnotesize\\raggedright\\printindex' is advisable
    # when the index is full of long entries.

# Use `xindy` rather than makeindex for preparing the index of general terms
# (from index usage). This means that words with UTF-8 characters will get

# use non-ascii characters from the language script.
